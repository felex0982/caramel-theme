# Caramel Theme for Wordpress

Website: caramel-wordpress.flellex.de

## About

Caramel is a simple and clean Portfolio-Theme for Wordpress, aiming for a slick looking site, set up in minutes and not depending on any Pagebuilders to achieve that.

## Basic Features

- Caramel is build on Understrap and is making use of gulp to make the dev process a lot smoother

## Development

- Run: `$ npm install`
- Run: `$ gulp watch` or
- Run with Browser-Sync:
- First change the browser-sync options to reflect your environment in the file `/gulpconfig.json` in the beginning of the file:

```javascript
{
    "browserSyncOptions" : {
        "proxy": "localhost/theme_test/", // <----- CHANGE HERE
        "notify": false
    },
    ...
};
```

- then run: `$ gulp watch-bs`

## Deployment

- When deploying this theme on the official Wordpress Container from Dockerhub the PHP-filesize has to be increased. Just add the following to the `.htaccess` of your container.

```
php_value post_max_size 24M
php_value upload_max_filesize 8M
```

## Style

- Caramel is using BEM

## WIP

- Uncluttering all the not needed features of Understrap, Caramel should stay minimalistc, also regarding the used files in Wordpress-Hierarchy
- At some point getting rid of jQuery, and switching to Bootstrap-Components
